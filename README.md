## Python Assignments

### Python Calculator.py

#### What I leanred. 
Well for starters I did not realize that it was possible to make an actual working calculator with Python. I already knew how to program in Python a LITTLE bit by which I mean this was not the first time I had attempted it but it was the first bigger assignment I ever did with it. In all honestly I really didn't find it all that hard. There were some commands that I had to google because I did not know how to tell the code to do certain things but once I got all the commands I needed and understood what I was doing it was pretty easy.

### Python Quadratic Solver

#### Lessons Learned.
Okay this one was significantly more challenging than the one before and took more time. One issue I ran into was that I had started working on my code one day and I guess I might have forgotten to save it or something because the next day it was completely gone which was very annoying. I am not amazing at math so I had forgotten how to even solve regular quadratic equations but once I refreshed my mind and remembered how the original Quadratic formula worked it became easier. I did not know that it was possible to solve quadratic equations using code by simple putting numbers in without signs or anything. I like coding so I tried my best to use my knowledge of python and math to challenge myself and figure out how to do this assignment while using as little help from google as possible. I ended up googling a few things towards the end but I tried to limit myself as much as possible for this assignment. I was also excited to be able to use arrays, not for a specific reason but mostly because I feel very confident in my ability to use them so I took the chance to do so for this too. arrays are cool idk. Overall it took me like a class period to finish the assignment and I felt very proud of myself afterowrds.

### Dice Roll 

#### Lessons learned
I found this assignment pretty simple honestly. I don't recall running into a lot of errors except for the fact that I had indented everything wrong which was keeping me from being able to run it but once Dr.Shields told me about that the code itself seemed to work pretty well. This assignment took me like the beginning of the block day or something.

### Hello World! (Bash Edition) 

#### Lessons Leanred 
This was by far the easiest assignment mostly because we have been making things say "hello world" since engineering back in 8th grade and still to this day. It was relatively easy to write the code itself except I struggled a lot more than I should have because of Bash and I just struggled with getting into bash and the terminal back and fourth and vice versa. Personally I found the whole Bash thing kind of weird but it was probably not as complicated as I made it seem just now.

### Python Calculator

#### Lessons Learned
The calculator took a bit of thinking on my behalf. The objective of the project was to program the raspberry pi to be able to solve simple mathematic equations consisitng of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. I wasn't really sure how to go about approaching this assignment at first because I always assumed that calculators and the functionality behind calculators was too complex. As it turned out, as soon as I figured out what I was supposed to do it really wasn't that hard afterall.

### Quadratic Equations Calculator

#### Lessons Learned
The objective of this assignment was to program a calculator on the Raspberry Pi using python. This calculator, contrary to normal calculators, is supposed to solve Quadratic equations. For starters I didn't even remember how to solve a quadratic equation on paper because I hadn't talked about it in math class for a little while. Once I did my bit of studying and refreshing my memory, I realized that they key to this assignment was the quadratic formula; or at least the way I chose to go about it. This was definitly one of the most difficult assignments coding wise at least just because at first for a while I didn't really know what to do. Eventually once I figured it all out it was pretty easy but it definitly took a bit of thinking.

### Strings and Loops

#### Lessons Learned
The point of this assignment was to write a code with an interface that would tell a user to type something, a sentence, a words, anything; afterwords, the code would run the sentence and or word so that it would be reprinted vertically. Before this school year, I wasn't really familiar with strings and the concept of being able to enter and print out actual words using code so that part was a little tricky to figure out, although the assignments on canvas actually do have a lot of useful coding tips that can really help throw you in the right direction if you have no idea how to even begin to go about something.

### Man Shaped Pi√±ata

#### Lessons Leanred
The objective of this assignment was to make a virtual game of hangman. This assingment definitly took me the most amount of time (or at least in comparison to those that came before it.) We had to write a code that would allow a player to type in a word (the word would not show) and then another player would get to guess what the word was by typing in letters in the keyboard. Like a classic game of hangman, if the second player guessed the letter incorrectly a computerized person would begin to show onto the computer (surprisngly this wasn't the hardest part.) It didn't take me long at all to write this code, given it had a lot of mistakes but I got the basiscs done relatively quickly. If I learned one important thing from this assignment is that rushing through code is NEVER a good idea unless you intend to spend the next few days troubleshooting. For starters,I had a bunch of random syntax errors including indenting and capitilzations and just really dumb stuff that could have easily been avoided had I handled the code a little more carefully. Once I got the code to actually run I started noticing more errors. I really should have planned this one out more thouroughly before starting to type into the computer. At first I couldn't get the characters that were supposed to make up the person to show up, once I figured that out there was a lot of problems with the actual spaces that the letters were supposed to go on. My algorithms were completely randomized and the code was a hot mess. Eventually, like literally weeks later, I was able to solve all of the problems with my code and get it working. So yeah, don't rush into coding in attempt to get through assignments or tasks faster because it can REALLY delay the process.
