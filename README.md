## Python Assignments

### Python Calculator.py

#### What I leanred. 
Well for starters I did not realize that it was possible to make an actual working calculator with Python. I already knew how to program in Python a LITTLE bit by which I mean this was not the first time I had attempted it but it was the first bigger assignment I ever did with it. In all honestly I really didn't find it all that hard. There were some commands that I had to google because I did not know how to tell the code to do certain things but once I got all the commands I needed and understood what I was doing it was pretty easy
